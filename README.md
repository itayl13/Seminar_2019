# Seminar_2019
This is the seminar GIT repository.
Please upload the paper you plan to work on and your code and results as a subdirectory with your initials.
Each person should have 
A) A paper from 2017 and later that discuss a new data science methods with access to the data.
B) An analysis of the paper and its novelty
C) An implementation of their concept on new data
D) A Presenation of the results

We will have two dates to present the results. One is the first Sunday after passover. The second one being the last Sunday of the semester.
The note will be split 30% on the presentation, 40 % on the implementation of the method on new data and 30 % on the student insight regarding the methods.

I strongly suggest choosing a paper with your thesis supervisor. 
As soon as you found a paper (or tried very hard and failed). Please contact me, and I will add you as a collaborator to the GIT.

I would appreciate receiving the chosen paper within two weeks
